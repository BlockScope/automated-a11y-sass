Sass functions that support accessible color contrast ratios

## Requirements

Minimum Sass version 3.4.25. Libsass 3.5.4 (best performance).

## Sandboxes

[Editable sandbox on CodePen to see how this all works](https://codepen.io/jhogue/pen/jOEXxZe?editors=1100). Change the color variables to see the updates in real-time within the size tests. 

When an edge case has been encountered, a version in SassMeister with debug output is helpful to see what might be happening (I changed the main function to a mixin so I can debug the output):
